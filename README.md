# CustomCapesV1 - Get any cape for free

# What is CustomCapesV1?
CustomCapes is a program that allows the user to use any cape they want! (requires optifine for it to work).

# Why should I use CustomCapesv1?
CustomCapesv1 is easy to use, it allows you to get your favourite capes for free and it also works on any client like Lunar, Badlion, Forge, etc. 

# What are the drawbacks?
Client side only! This means only you are able to see it.
The script has to run until you join a world/server.

# How does it work?
When optifine sends a request to their cape server, the script changes that redirect to the local computer and returns the cape that you have selected.

# Why does this require admin rights?
This is because the script modifies a file that needs admin rights to open which is where it redirects optifine to your Local pc. To run this as an admin right click the exe and click "Run as Administrator".

# When should I not use CustomCapes?
1. If you have Forge or Fabric as there will be mods allowing you to customize your cape that are 10x better than this.
2. If you use don't use Optifine, as this program only works if you use it. 

# If it doesnt work where can I report a bug?
